# Real World Scenario: Aerial Image Classification

This example demonstrates how to use Azure Machine Learning (AML) Workbench to coordinate distributed training and operationalization of image classification models. We use the [Microsoft Machine Learning for Apache Spark (MMLSpark)](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark) package to featurize images using pretrained CNTK models and train classifiers using the derived features. We then apply the trained models in parallel fashion to large image sets in the cloud. These steps are performed on an [Azure HDInsight Spark](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/apache-spark/) cluster, allowing us to scale the speed of training and operationalization by adding or removing worker nodes.

The form of transfer learning we demonstrate has major advantages over retraining or fine-tuning a deep neural network: it does not require GPU compute, is inherently fast and arbitrarily scalable, and fits fewer parameters. This method is therefore an excellent choice when few training samples are available -- as is often the case for custom use cases. Many users report that transfer learning produces highly performant models, allowing them to avoid deep neural networks trained from scratch at much greater cost.

## Use case description

In this scenario, we train deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify the type of land shown in aerial images of 224-meter x 224-meter plots. Land use classification models can be used to track urbanization, deforestation, loss of wetlands, and other major environmental trends using periodically collected aerial imagery. We have prepared training and validation image sets based on imagery from the U.S. National Agriculture Imagery Program and land use labels published by the U.S. National Land Cover Database. After training and validating the classifier model, we will apply it to aerial images spanning Middlesex County, MA -- home of Microsoft's New England Research & Development (NERD) Center -- to demonstrate how these models can be used to study trends in urban development.

To produce an image classifier using transfer learning, data scientists often construct multiple models with a range of methods and select the most performant model. Azure Machine Learning Workbench can help data scientists coordinate training across compute environments, track and compare the performance of multiple models, and apply a chosen model to large datasets on the cloud.

## Set up the execution environment

Before beginning this tutorial, it is necessary to create an HDInsight cluster and ensure that it can access all necessary packages, sample data, and pretrained CNTK models. The following instructions guide you through this process.

Prerequisites:
- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) (free trials are available)
- [Azure Machine Learning Workbench](./overview-what-is-azure-ml.md)
    - Follow the [quick start installation guide](./quick-start-installation.md) to install the program and create a workspace
- [AzCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy), a free utility for coordinating file transfer between Azure storage accounts

<a name="resources"></a>
### Deploy Azure resources

This tutorial requires an HDInsight Spark cluster and an Azure storage account to host relevant files. Follow these instructions to create these resources in a new Azure resource group:

<a name="clilogin"></a>
#### Log in to the Azure Command Line Interface and create the resource group

Load the Aerial Image Classification project in Azure Machine Learning Workbench as follows:

1. Open Azure Machine Learning Workbench.
1. Create a new project by clicking File -> New Project.
1. Select a project name, local directory for storing project files, and workspace.
1. In the list of project templates, select "Aerial Image Classification."
1. Click "Create."

    Your screen should update as the new project is loaded in Workbench.

1. From your AML Workbench project, open a Command Line Interface (CLI) by clicking File -> Open Command Prompt.
1. From the command line interface, log in to your Azure account by running the following command:

    ````
    az login
    ```

    You are asked to visit a URL and type in a provided temporary code; the website requests your Azure account credentials.
1. When login is complete, return to the CLI and run the following command to determine which Azure subscriptions are available to your Azure account:

    ```
    az account list
    ```

    This command lists all subscriptions associated with your Azure account. Find the ID of the subscription you would like to use. Write the subscription ID where indicated in the following command, then set the active subscription by executing the command:

    ```
    az account set --subscription [subscription ID]
    ```

1. The Azure resources created in this example are stored together in an Azure resource group. Choose a unique resource group name and write it where indicated, then execute both commands to create the Azure resource group:

    ```
    set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=[resource group name]
    az group create --location eastus --name %AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP%
    ```

<a name="storage"></a>
#### Create the storage account

We now create the storage account that hosts project files that must be accessed by the HDInsight Spark.

1. Choose a unique storage account name and write it where indicated in the following `set` command, then create an Azure storage account by executing both commands:

    ```
    set STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=[storage account name]
    az storage account create --name %STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME% --resource-group %AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP% --sku Standard_LRS
    ```

1. Issue the following command to list the storage account keys:

    ```
    az storage account keys list --resource-group %AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP% --account-name %STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME%
    ```

    Record the value of `key1` where indicated in the following command, then run the command to store the value.
    ```
    set STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=[storage account key]
    ```
1. In your favorite text editor, load the `settings.cfg` file from the AML Workbench project's "Code" subdirectory, and insert the storage account name and key as indicated. Save and close the `settings.cfg` file.
1. If you have not already done so, download and install the [AzCopy](http://aka.ms/downloadazcopy) utility.
1. Issue the following commands to copy all of the sample data, pretrained models, and model training scripts to the appropriate locations in your storage account:

    ```
    AzCopy /Source:https://mawahsparktutorial.blob.core.windows.net/test /SourceSAS:"?sv=2017-04-17&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rwl&se=2037-08-25T22:02:55Z&st=2017-08-25T14:02:55Z&spr=https,http&sig=yyO6fyanu9ilAeW7TpkgbAqeTnrPR%2BpP1eh9TcpIXWw%3D" /Dest:https://%STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME%.blob.core.windows.net/test /DestKey:%STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY% /S
    AzCopy /Source:https://mawahsparktutorial.blob.core.windows.net/train /SourceSAS:"?sv=2017-04-17&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rwl&se=2037-08-25T22:02:55Z&st=2017-08-25T14:02:55Z&spr=https,http&sig=yyO6fyanu9ilAeW7TpkgbAqeTnrPR%2BpP1eh9TcpIXWw%3D" /Dest:https://%STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME%.blob.core.windows.net/train /DestKey:%STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY% /S

    ```

    Expect file transfer to take up to 20 minutes. While you wait, you can proceed to the following section. You may need to open another Command Line Interface through Workbench and redefine the temporary variables there.

<a name="hdinsight"></a>
#### Create the HDInsight Spark cluster

Our recommended method to create an HDInsight cluster uses the HDInsight Spark cluster Resource Manager template included in the "Code\01_Data_Acquisition_and_Understanding\01_HDInsight_Spark_Provisioning" subfolder of this tutorial.

1. Choose a unique name and password for the HDInsight cluster and write them where indicated in the following command. Then create the cluster by issuing the following command:

    ```
    set HDINSIGHT_CLUSTER_NAME=[HDInsight cluster name]
    set HDINSIGHT_CLUSTER_PASSWORD=[HDInsight cluster password]
    az group deployment create --resource-group %AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP% --name hdispark --template-file "Code\01_Data_Acquisition_and_Understanding\01_HDInsight_Spark_Provisioning\template.json" --parameters storageAccountName=%STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME%.blob.core.windows.net storageAccountKey=%STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY% clusterName=%HDINSIGHT_CLUSTER_NAME% clusterLoginPassword=%HDINSIGHT_CLUSTER_PASSWORD%
    ```

Your cluster's deployment may take up to 30 minutes (including provisioning and script action execution).

<a name="amlwb"></a>
### Prepare the AML Workbench execution environment

<a name="register"></a>
#### Register the HDInsight cluster as an AML Workbench compute target

Once HDInsight cluster creation is complete, register the cluster as a compute target for your project as follows:

1.  Issue the following command from the Azure Machine Learning Command Line Interface:

    ```
    az ml computetarget attach --name myhdi --address %HDINSIGHT_CLUSTER_NAME%-ssh.azurehdinsight.net --username sshuser --password %HDINSIGHT_CLUSTER_PASSWORD% -t cluster
    ```

    This command adds two files, `myhdi.runconfig` and `myhdi.compute`, to your project's `aml_config` folder.

1. Run the following command to prepare your environment for use:
   ```
   az ml experiment prepare -c myhdi
   ```

<a name="dependencies"></a>
#### Install local dependencies

Open a CLI from AML Workbench and install dependencies needed for local execution by issuing the following command:

```
pip install matplotlib azure-storage==0.36.0 pillow scikit-learn
```

<a name="dataunderstanding"></a>
## Data acquisition and understanding

During setup, the aerial image sets used in this tutorial were transferred to the storage account that you created. The training, validation, and operationalization images are all 224 pixel x 224 pixel PNG files at a resolution of one pixel per square meter. The training and validation images have been organized into subfolders based on their land use label. (The land use labels of the operationalization images are unknown and in many cases ambiguous; some of these images contain multiple land types.) For more information on how these image sets were constructed, see the [Embarrassingly Parallel Image Classification git repository](https://github.com/Azure/Embarrassingly-Parallel-Image-Classification).

To view example images:
1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for the name of your storage account in the search bar along the top of your screen. Click on your storage account in the search results.
2. Click on the "Blobs" link in the storage account's main pane.
3. Click on the container named "train." You should see a list of directories named according to land use.
4. Click on any of these directories to load the list of images it contains.
5. Click on any image and download it to view the image.

The training and validation datasets contain ~44,000 images (4 GB) and ~11k images (1 GB), respectively. The operationalization dataset contains ~67,000 images (6 GB).

## Modeling

<a name="mmlsparktrain"></a>
### Training models with MMLSpark
The `run_mmlspark.py` script in the "Code\02_Modeling" subfolder of the Workbench project is used to train an [MMLSpark](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark) model for image classification. The script first featurizes the training set images using an image classifier DNN pretrained on the ImageNet dataset (either AlexNet or an 18-layer ResNet). The script then uses the featurized images to train an MMLSpark model (either a random forest or a logistic regression model) to classify the images. The test image set is then featurized and scored with the trained model. The accuracy of the model's predictions on the test set is calculated and logged to AML Workbench's run history feature. Finally, the trained MMLSpark model and its predictions on the test set are saved to blob storage.

Select a name for your trained model, a pretrained model type, and an MMLSpark model type. Write your selections where indicated in the following command, then begin retraining by executing the command from an Azure ML Command Line Interface:

```
az ml experiment submit -c myhdi Code\02_Modeling\run_mmlspark.py --config_filename Code/settings.cfg --output_model_name [unique model name, alphanumeric characters only] --pretrained_model_type {alexnet,resnet18} --mmlspark_model_type {randomforest,logisticregression}
```

An additional `--sample_frac` parameter can be used to train and test the model with a subset of available data. Using a small sample fraction decreases runtime at the expense of accuracy. For more information on this and other parameters, run `python run_mmlspark.py -h`.

Users are encouraged to run this script several times with different input parameters. The performance of the resulting models can then be compared in AML Workbench's Run History feature.

<a name="comparing"></a>
### Comparing model performance using the Workbench Run History feature

After you have executed two or more training runs of either type, navigate to the Run History feature in Workbench by clicking the clock icon along the left-hand menu bar. Select `run_mmlspark.py` from the list of scripts at left. A pane loads comparing the test set accuracy for all runs. To see more detail, scroll down and click on the name of an individual run.

<a name="deployment"></a>
## Deployment

To apply one of your trained models to aerial images tiling Middlesex County, MA using remote execution on HDInsight, insert your desired model's name into the following command and execute it:

```
az ml experiment submit -c myhdi Code\03_Deployment\batch_score_spark.py --config_filename Code/settings.cfg --output_model_name [trained model name chosen earlier]
```

This script writes the model's predictions to your storage account. The predictions can be examined as described in the next section.

<a name="visualization"></a>
## Visualization

The "Model prediction analysis" Jupyter notebook in the "Code\04_Result_Analysis" subfolder of the Workbench project visualizes a model's predictions. Load and run the notebook as follows:
1. Open the project in Workbench and click on the folder ("Files") icon along the left-hand menu to load the directory listing.
2. Navigate to the "Code\04_Result_Analysis" subfolder and click on the notebook named "Model prediction analysis." A preview rendering of the notebook should be displayed.
3. Click "Start Notebook Server" to load the notebook.
4. In the first cell, enter the name of the model whose results you would like to analyze where indicated.
5. Click on "Cell -> Run All" to execute all cells in the notebook.
6. Read along with the notebook to learn more about the analyses and visualizations it presents.

## Conclusions and next steps

Azure Machine Learning Workbench helps data scientists easily deploy their code on remote compute targets. In this example, local code was deployed for remote execution on an HDInsight cluster. Azure Machine Learning Workbench's run history feature tracked the performance of multiple models and helped us identify the most accurate model. Workbench's Jupyter notebooks feature helped visualize our models' predictions in an interactive, graphical environment.
